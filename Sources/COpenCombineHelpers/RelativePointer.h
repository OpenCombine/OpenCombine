/// Some data structures emitted by the Swift compiler use relative indirect
/// addresses in order to minimize startup cost for a process. By referring to
/// the offset of the global offset table entry for a symbol, instead of
/// directly referring to the symbol, compiler-emitted data structures avoid
/// requiring unnecessary relocation at dynamic linking time. This header
/// contains types to help dereference these relative addresses.
///
/// Theory of references to objects
/// -------------------------------
///
/// A reference can be absolute or relative:
///
///   - An absolute reference is a pointer to the object.
///
///   - A relative reference is a (signed) offset from the address of the
///     reference to the address of its direct referent.
///
/// A relative reference can be direct, indirect, or symbolic.
///
/// In a direct reference, the direct referent is simply the target object.
/// Generally, a statically-emitted relative reference can only be direct
/// if it can be resolved to a constant offset by the linker, because loaders
/// do not support forming relative references.  This means that either the
/// reference and object must lie within the same linkage unit or the
/// difference must be computed at runtime by code.
///
/// In a symbolic reference, the direct referent is a string holding the symbol
/// name of the object.  A relative reference can only be symbolic if the
/// object actually has a symbol at runtime, which may require exporting
/// many internal symbols that would otherwise be strippable.
///
/// In an indirect reference, the direct referent is a variable holding an
/// absolute reference to the object.  An indirect relative reference may
/// refer to an arbitrary symbol, be it anonymous within the linkage unit
/// or completely external to it, but it requires the introduction of an
/// intermediate absolute reference that requires load-time initialization.
/// However, this initialization can be shared among all indirect references
/// within the linkage unit, and the linker will generally place all such
/// references adjacent to one another to improve load-time locality.
///
/// A reference can be made a dynamic union of more than one of these options.
/// This allows the compiler/linker to use a direct reference when possible
/// and a less-efficient option where required.  However, it also requires
/// the cases to be dynamically distinguished.  This can be done by setting
/// a low bit of the offset, as long as the difference between the direct
/// referent's address and the reference is a multiple of 2.  This works well
/// for "indirectable" references because most objects are known to be
/// well-aligned, and the cases that aren't (chiefly functions and strings)
/// rarely need the flexibility of this kind of reference.  It does not
/// work quite as well for "possibly symbolic" references because C strings
/// are not naturally aligned, and making them aligned generally requires
/// moving them out of the linker's ordinary string section; however, it's
/// still workable.
///
/// Finally, a relative reference can be near or far.  A near reference
/// is potentially smaller, but it requires the direct referent to lie
/// within a certain distance of the reference, even if dynamically
/// initialized.
///
/// In Swift, we always prefer to use a near direct relative reference
/// when it is possible to do so: that is, when the relationship is always
/// between two global objects emitted in the same linkage unit, and there
/// is no compatibility constraint requiring the use of an absolute reference.
///
/// When more flexibility is required, there are several options:
///
///   1. Use an absolute reference.  Size penalty on 64-bit.  Requires
///      load-time work.
///
///   2. Use a far direct relative reference.  Size penalty on 64-bit.
///      Requires load-time work when object is outside linkage unit.
///      Generally not directly supported by loaders.
///
///   3. Use an always-indirect relative reference.  Size penalty of one
///      pointer (shared).  Requires load-time work even when object is
///      within linkage unit.
///
///   4. Use a near indirectable relative reference.  Size penalty of one
///      pointer (shared) when reference exceeds range.  Runtime / code-size
///      penalty on access.  Requires load-time work (shared) only when
///      object is outside linkage unit.
///
///   5. Use a far indirectable relative reference.  Size penalty on 64-bit.
///      Size penalty of one pointer (shared) when reference exceeds range
///      and is initialized statically.  Runtime / code-size penalty on access.
///      Requires load-time work (shared) only when object is outside linkage
///      unit.
///
///   6. Use a near or far symbolic relative reference.  No load-time work.
///      Severe runtime penalty on access.  Requires custom logic to statically
///      optimize.  Requires emission of symbol for target even if private
///      to linkage unit.
///
///   7. Use a near or far direct-or-symbolic relative reference.  No
///      load-time work.  Severe runtime penalty on access if object is
///      outside of linkage unit.  Requires custom logic to statically optimize.
///
/// In general, it's our preference in Swift to use option #4 when there
/// is no possibility of initializing the reference dynamically and option #5
/// when there is.  This is because it is infeasible to actually share the
/// memory for the intermediate absolute reference when it must be allocated
/// dynamically.
///
/// Symbolic references are an interesting idea that we have not yet made
/// use of.  They may be acceptable in reflective metadata cases where it
/// is desirable to heavily bias towards never using the metadata.  However,
/// they're only profitable if there wasn't any other indirect reference
/// to the target, and it is likely that their optimal use requires a more
/// intelligent toolchain from top to bottom.
///
/// Note that the cost of load-time work also includes a binary-size penalty
/// to store the loader metadata necessary to perform that work.  Therefore
/// it is better to avoid it even when there are dynamic optimizations in
/// place to skip the work itself.
