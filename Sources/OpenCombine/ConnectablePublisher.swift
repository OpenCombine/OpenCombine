/// Use a `ConnectablePublisher` when you need to perform additional configuration or
/// setup prior to producing any elements.

/// This publisher doesnâ€™t produce any elements until you call its `connect()` method.

/// Use `makeConnectable()` to create a `ConnectablePublisher` from any publisher whose
/// failure type is `Never`.

    /// an instance with which to cancel publishing.
