    ///
    /// For example, given the type `AnyPublisher<URLSession.DataTaskPublisher, NSError>`,
    /// calling `switchToLatest()` results in the type
    /// `SwitchToLatest<(Data, URLResponse), URLError>`.

    /// cancels its previous subscription. Use this feature to prevent earlier publishers
    /// from performing unnecessary work, such as creating network request publishers from
    /// frequently updating user interface publishers.
    ///
    /// The following example updates a `PassthroughSubject` with a new value every
    /// `0.1` seconds. A `map(_:)` operator receives the new value and uses it to create
    /// a new `URLSession.DataTaskPublisher`. By using the `switchToLatest()` operator,
    /// the downstream sink subscriber receives the `(Data, URLResponse)` output type from
    /// the data task publishers, rather than the `URLSession.DataTaskPublisher` type
    /// produced by the `map(_:)` operator. Furthermore, creating each new data task
    /// publisher cancels the previous data task publisher.
    ///
    ///     let subject = PassthroughSubject<Int, Never>()
    ///     cancellable = subject
    ///         .setFailureType(to: URLError.self)
    ///         .map() { index -> URLSession.DataTaskPublisher in
