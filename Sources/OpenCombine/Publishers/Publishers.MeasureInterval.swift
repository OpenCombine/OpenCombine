    /// from an upstream publisher.
    ///
    /// In the example below, a 1-second `Timer` is used as the data source for an event
    /// publisher; the `measureInterval(using:options:)` operator reports the elapsed time
    /// between the reception of events on the main run loop:
    ///
    ///     cancellable = Timer.publish(every: 1, on: .main, in: .default)
    ///         .autoconnect()
    ///         .measureInterval(using: RunLoop.main)
    ///         .sink { print("\($0)", terminator: "\n") }
    ///
    ///     // Prints:
    ///     //      Stride(magnitude: 1.0013610124588013)
    ///     //      Stride(magnitude: 0.9992760419845581)
    ///
    /// The output type of the returned publisher is the time interval of the provided
    /// scheduler.
    ///
    /// This operator uses the provided schedulerâ€™s `now` property to measure intervals
    /// between events.
