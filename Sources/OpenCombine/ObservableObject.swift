// We use type metadata in the implementation of ObservableObject,
// but type metadata is stable only on Darwin. There are no such guarantees
// on non-Apple platforms (yet).
//
// This means that on Linux the layout of type metadata can change in a new Swift release,
// which will cause bugs that are hard to track (basically, undefined behavior).
//
// Whenever a new Swift version is available, we well test OpenCombine against it,
// and if everything works, release an update as soon as possible where the maximum
// supported Swift version is incremented.
#if !canImport(Darwin) && swift(>=5.1.50)
#warning("""
ObservableObject is not guaranteed to work on non-Apple platforms with this version \
of Swift because its implementation relies on ABI stability.

In order to fix this warning, please update to the newest version of OpenCombine, \
or create an issue at https://github.com/broadwaylamb/OpenCombine if there is no \
newer version yet.
