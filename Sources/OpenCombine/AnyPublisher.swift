extension Publisher {
    /// Wraps this publisher with a type eraser.
    ///
    /// Use ``Publisher/eraseToAnyPublisher()`` to expose an instance of ``AnyPublisher`` to the downstream subscriber, rather than this publisher’s actual type.
    /// This form of _type erasure_ preserves abstraction across API boundaries, such as different modules.
    /// When you expose your publishers as the ``AnyPublisher`` type, you can change the underlying implementation over time without affecting existing clients.
    ///
    /// The following example shows two types that each have a `publisher` property. `TypeWithSubject` exposes this property as its actual type, ``PassthroughSubject``, while `TypeWithErasedSubject` uses ``Publisher/eraseToAnyPublisher()`` to expose it as an ``AnyPublisher``. As seen in the output, a caller from another module can access `TypeWithSubject.publisher` as its native type. This means you can’t change your publisher to a different type without breaking the caller. By comparison, `TypeWithErasedSubject.publisher` appears to callers as an ``AnyPublisher``, so you can change the underlying publisher type at will.
    ///
    ///     public class TypeWithSubject {
    ///         public let publisher: some Publisher = PassthroughSubject<Int,Never>()

    ///         public let publisher: some Publisher = PassthroughSubject<Int,Never>()
    ///             .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     // In another module:
    ///     let nonErased = TypeWithSubject()
    ///     if let subject = nonErased.publisher as? PassthroughSubject<Int,Never> {
    ///         print("Successfully cast nonErased.publisher.")
    ///     }
    ///     let erased = TypeWithErasedSubject()
    ///     if let subject = erased.publisher as? PassthroughSubject<Int,Never> {
    ///         print("Successfully cast erased.publisher.")
    ///     }
    ///
    ///     // Prints "Successfully cast nonErased.publisher."
    ///

/// A publisher that performs type erasure by wrapping another publisher.
///
/// ``AnyPublisher`` is a concrete implementation of ``Publisher`` that has no significant properties of its own, and passes through elements and completion values from its upstream publisher.
///
/// Use ``AnyPublisher`` to wrap a publisher whose type has details you don’t want to expose across API boundaries, such as different modules. Wrapping a ``Subject`` with ``AnyPublisher`` also prevents callers from accessing its ``Subject/send(_:)`` method. When you use type erasure this way, you can change the underlying publisher implementation over time without affecting existing clients.
