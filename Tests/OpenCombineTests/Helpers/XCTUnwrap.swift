private struct UnwrappingFailure: Error {}

/// Asserts that an expression is not `nil`, and returns its unwrapped value.
///
/// Generates a failure when `expression == nil`.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - expression: An expression of type `T?` to compare against `nil`. Its type will determine the type of
///     the returned value.
///   - message: An optional description of the failure.
///   - file: The file in which failure occurred. Defaults to the file name of the test case in which this function was
///     called.
///   - line: The line number on which failure occurred. Defaults to the line number on which this function was called.
/// - Returns: A value of type `T`, the result of evaluating and unwrapping the given `expression`.
/// - Throws: An error when `expression == nil`. It will also rethrow any error thrown while evaluating the given
///   expression.
